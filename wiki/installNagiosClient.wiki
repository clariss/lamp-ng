Each one of the clients will need to have this installed and configured. On each machine that the Nagios host will contact to execute plugins remotely, issue 
{{{
apt-get install nagios-nrpe-server
apt-get install nagios-plugins
}}}

Make sure the nrpe daemon is running:
{{{
netstat -at | grep nrpe
}}}
The output out this command should show something like this:
{{{
tcp 0 0 *:nrpe *:* LISTEN
}}}


Edit NRPE configuration file to allow monitoring host access to remote host:
{{{
vi /etc/nagios/nrpe_local.cfg
}}}

add the following line (replace IP address with IP of monitoring host):
{{{
allowed_hosts=192.168.0.4
}}}

Test that remote and monitoring hosts can communicate. On the monitoring host, issue (replace IP by the one of the remote host):
{{{
/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H 192.168.0.11
}}}

You should get back the NRPE version:
{{{
NRPE v2.12
}}}

Try a simple check (replace the ip by the one of the remote host):
{{{
/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H 192.168.0.11 -c check_users
}}}
